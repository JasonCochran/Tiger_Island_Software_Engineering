/*
Scenario: Settlement Size of 1 stops tile placement
X    Given I have initialized a board
	And placed two tiles adjacent to each other with two touching hexagons across tiles
	And the tiles have adjacent volcanoes
	And There is a meeple on a non-volcano hexagon which is adjacent to both volcanos
	And There are no other meeples on the board
    When I attempt to place a tile on a volcano so it overlaps onto the other tile
	And The tile would overwrite the meeple
    Then The operation should fail
