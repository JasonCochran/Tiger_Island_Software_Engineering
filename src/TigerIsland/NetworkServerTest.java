/*
       The server has to be run first, and it takes in a port for an argument.
       Use 4432.

       So the4 server and client are configured to send a line back and forth to each other.
       Right now I have them hooked up to standard input (the terminal).
       The goal is to have the client hooked up to the parser so it can reply back to the server automatically.

       The server sends out the first message, and the client must reply with a message in order to receive
       the next message from the server. This back and forth continues until server replies with "Bye."

       WELCOME TO ANOTHER EDITION OF THUNDERDOME!
       TWO SHALL ENTER, ONE SHALL LEAVE
       WAIT FOR THE TOURNAMENT TO BEGIN 945
